You work at a service company. Each service is defined by a queue (pick_queue), that queue contains the order of the people in the queue, but as you can see, the database (users_data) did not return the user in order of pick, he was asked to develop a function that given the user's number (pick_index) it would return the user.

In the case of the example below the if, it should return {"name": "Mourinha", "id": 14}, as this user is position 5 in the queue.

Try to develop without regard to complexity, then write down what you have observed and try to develop a more optimized way.
