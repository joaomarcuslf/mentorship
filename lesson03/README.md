# Data Structure #03

You should implement the `queue`, `stack`, `deck`, and the `sorted_list`.

Check the tests for each file, there you can understand what is expected of the code result.

We will skip code foor both `graph`, and `tree`, next lessons we will explore then deeply.

## Advanced Topics

Now, after we have implemented the `sorted_list`, and worked before with, we can compare how searching for a index inside an array work.

### Ex.01: Get index in unsorted array

Given this unsorted list, can you implement a search index algorithm for this code?

```py
unsorted_list = [ 2, 1, 3, 9, 4, 5, 8, 7, 6 ]
```

### Ex.02: Get index in sorted array

Given this sorted, can you implement an better code for a search index algorithm?

```py
sorted_list = [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 ]
```

If you have some trouble with those, look at the `advanced_topics.complete.py` file.
